Services for autocompletion go to a CherryPy process exposing a Redis cache

Service 1 - Autocomplete
========================
CherryPy
--------
On http://fogtest.com/crm_test/ , where it says 'Enter a few letters of customer name or site name '

type either 'att' or 'abb', to do autocompletes on customer names,

Those strings will make service calls to 
http://fogtest.com/customers_test/?term=att
and
http://fogtest.com/customers_test/?term=abb

These are to python micro-framework querying a Redis cache

Service 2 - Autocomplete
========================
CherryPy
--------

goto http://fogtest.com/crm_test/rma/create/

in field 'Customer*', type 'abb'

This will call service
http://fogtest.com/customers_test/rma_customer_dropdown_service/?term=abb

Services for reports go through Django

Service 3
=========
Django
--------

While logged in goto 

http://fogtest.com/crm_test/rma/edit/1796
