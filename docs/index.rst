Welcome to Enlighted's CRM documentation!
=========================================

Sites
-----
To start development, we are going to use the Django admin panel to start laying out the data before designing any
workflow UI.

* Production http://crm1.corp.enlightedinc.com/crm/rma
* Test http://crm1.corp.enlightedinc.com/crm_test/rma
For more information about differences between the production site and the test site - :ref:`sites`
