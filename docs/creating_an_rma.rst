Creating An RMA
===============
RMAs can be created for new or existing customers.

To add a new RMA, go to the crm's home page, the first page that opens up, or press the navigation button
'RMA".  You should see a list of
RMAs and a green button that says 'New'.  Press new.

You will see the form for entering new RMA's for existing customers.
If this is an existing customer, continue to fill out the form.

Create An RMA for an existing customer
--------------------------------------
If the customer exists on the customer list you do not need to enter a new customer with the new rma.  You can just
select the customer from the drop-down list.
